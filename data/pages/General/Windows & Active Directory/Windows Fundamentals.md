| ProgramData                | This is a hidden folder that contains data that is essential for certain installed programs to run. This data is accessible by the program no matter what user is running it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Users                      | This folder contains user profiles for each user that logs onto the system and contains the two folders Public and Default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Default                    | This is the default user profile template for all created users. Whenever a new user is added to the system, their profile is based on the Default profile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Public                     | This folder is intended for computer users to share files and is accessible to all users by default. This folder is shared over the network by default but requires a valid network account to access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| AppData                    | Per user application data and settings are stored in a hidden user subfolder (i.e., cliff.moore\AppData). Each of these folders contains three subfolders. The Roaming folder contains machine-independent data that should follow the user's profile, such as custom dictionaries. The Local folder is specific to the computer itself and is never synchronized across the network. LocalLow is similar to the Local folder, but it has a lower data integrity level. Therefore it can be used, for example, by a web browser set to protected or safe mode. |
| Windows                    | The majority of the files required for the Windows operating system are contained here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| System, System32, SysWOW64 | Contains all DLLs required for the core features of Windows and the Windows API. The operating system searches these folders any time a program asks to load a DLL without specifying an absolute path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| WinSxS                     | The Windows Component Store contains a copy of all Windows components, updates, and service packs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
#### File System
There are 5 types of Windows file systems: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, NTFS, and exFAT.
#### NTFS 
NTFS (New Technology File System) is the default Windows file system since Windows NT 3.1. In addition to making up for the shortcomings of FAT32, NTFS also has better support for metadata and better performance due to improved data structuring.

### Permissions

The NTFS file system has many basic and advanced permissions. Some of the key permission types are:

| Permission Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

#### SMB 
The `Server Message Block protocol` (`SMB`) is used in Windows to connect shared resources like files and printers. It is used in large, medium, and small enterprise environments.

#### Windows Services & Processes
Processes run in the background on Windows systems. They either run automatically as part of the Windows operating system or are started by other installed applications.

Examples include the Windows Logon Application, System, System Idle Process, Windows Start-Up Application, Client Server Runtime, Windows Session Manager, Service Host, and Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process.

```java
Get-Service | ? {$_.Status -eq "Running"} | select -First 2 |fl
```

|Service|Description|
|---|---|
|smss.exe|Session Manager SubSystem. Responsible for handling sessions on the system.|
|csrss.exe|Client Server Runtime Process. The user-mode portion of the Windows subsystem.|
|wininit.exe|Starts the Wininit file .ini file that lists all of the changes to be made to Windows when the computer is restarted after installing a program.|
|logonui.exe|Used for facilitating user login into a PC|
|lsass.exe|The Local Security Authentication Server verifies the validity of user logons to a PC or server. It generates the process responsible for authenticating users for the Winlogon service.|
|services.exe|Manages the operation of starting and stopping services.|
|winlogon.exe|Responsible for handling the secure attention sequence, loading a user profile on logon, and locking the computer when a screensaver is running.|
|System|A background system process that runs the Windows kernel.|
|svchost.exe with RPCSS|Manages system services that run from dynamic-link libraries (files with the extension .dll) such as "Automatic Updates," "Windows Firewall," and "Plug and Play." Uses the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service (RPCSS).|
|svchost.exe with Dcom/PnP|Manages system services that run from dynamic-link libraries (files with the extension .dll) such as "Automatic Updates," "Windows Firewall," and "Plug and Play." Uses the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) and Plug and Play (PnP) services.|
#### Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)
`lsass.exe` is the process that is responsible for enforcing the security policy on Windows systems.
LSASS is an extremely high-value target as several tools exist to extract both cleartext and hashed credentials stored in memory by this process.

#### Service Permissions
Sysadmins often overlook them as potential threat vectors that can be used to load malicious DLLs, execute applications without access to an admin account, escalate privileges and even maintain persistence.

#### Examining services using sc

```java
C:\Users\USERNAME>sc qc wuauserv
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: wuauserv
        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 3   DEMAND_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : Windows Update
        DEPENDENCIES       : rpcss
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
```

The `sc qc` command is used to query the service. This is where knowing the names of services can come in handy. If we wanted to query a service on a device over the network, we could specify the hostname or IP address immediately after `sc`.

```java
C:\Users\USERNAME>sc //hostname or ip of box query ServiceName
```

sc to start and stop services.

```java
C:\Users\USERNAME> sc stop wuauserv
```

```java
C:\WINDOWS\system32> sc config wuauserv binPath=C:\Winbows\Perfectlylegitprogram.exe

[SC] ChangeServiceConfig SUCCESS

C:\WINDOWS\system32> sc qc wuauserv

[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: wuauserv
        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 3   DEMAND_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Winbows\Perfectlylegitprogram.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : Windows Update
        DEPENDENCIES       : rpcss
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
```

Examine service permissions using `sc` is through the `sdshow` command.
```java
C:\WINDOWS\system32> sc sdshow wuauserv
D:(A;;CCLCSWRPLORC;;;AU)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;SY)S:(AU;FA;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOSDRCWDWO;;;WD)
```
Security descriptors identify the object’s owner and a primary group containing a `Discretionary Access Control List` (`DACL`) and a `System Access Control List` (`SACL`).
DACL is used for controlling access to an object, and a SACL is used to account for and log access attempts.

```java
D: (A;;CCLCSWRPLORC;;;AU)

1. D: - the proceeding characters are DACL permissions
2. AU: - defines the security principal Authenticated Users
3. A;; - access is allowed
4. CC - SERVICE_QUERY_CONFIG is the full name, and it is a query to the service control manager (SCM) for the service configuration
5. LC - SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS is the full name, and it is a query to the service control manager (SCM) for the current status of the service
6. SW - SERVICE_ENUMERATE_DEPENDENTS is the full name, and it will enumerate a list of dependent services
7. RP - SERVICE_START is the full name, and it will start the service
8. LO - SERVICE_INTERROGATE is the full name, and it will query the service for its current status
9. RC - READ_CONTROL is the full name, and it will query the security descriptor of the service
```

```java
;;CCLCSWRPLORC;;;

After the last set of semi-colons, the characters specify the security principal (User and/or Group) that is permitted to perform those actions.

;;;AU

The character immediately after the opening parentheses and before the first set of semi-colons defines whether the actions are Allowed or Denied.

A;;

This entire security descriptor associated with the `Windows Update` (`wuauserv`) service has three sets of access control entries because there are three different security principals. Each security principal has specific permissions applied.
```

#### Examine service permissions using PowerShell
Using the `Get-Acl` PowerShell cmdlet, we can examine service permissions by targeting the path of a specific service in the registry.
```java
Get-ACL -Path HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\wuauserv | Format-List
```

```java
PS C:\Users\htb-student> Get-ACL -Path HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\wuauserv | Format-List

| Local System Account    | Also known as the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, this is the most powerful account in Windows systems. It is used for a variety of OS-related tasks, such as starting Windows services. This account is more powerful than accounts in the local administrators group. |
| Local Service Account   | Known as the `NT AUTHORITY\LocalService` account, this is a less privileged version of the SYSTEM account and has similar privileges to a local user account. It is granted limited functionality and can start some services.                                         |
| Network Service Account | This is known as the `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService` account and is similar to a standard domain user account. It has similar privileges to the Local Service Account on the local machine. It can establish authenticated sessions for certain network services.        |
#### Execution Policy

|**Policy**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`AllSigned`|All scripts can run, but a trusted publisher must sign scripts and configuration files. This includes both remote and local scripts. We receive a prompt before running scripts signed by publishers that we have not yet listed as either trusted or untrusted.|
|`Bypass`|No scripts or configuration files are blocked, and the user receives no warnings or prompts.|
|`Default`|This sets the default execution policy, `Restricted` for Windows desktop machines and `RemoteSigned` for Windows servers.|
|`RemoteSigned`|Scripts can run but requires a digital signature on scripts that are downloaded from the internet. Digital signatures are not required for scripts that are written locally.|
|`Restricted`|This allows individual commands but does not allow scripts to be run. All script file types, including configuration files (`.ps1xml`), module script files (`.psm1`), and PowerShell profiles (`.ps1`) are blocked.|
|`Undefined`|No execution policy is set for the current scope. If the execution policy for ALL scopes is set to undefined, then the default execution policy of `Restricted` will be used.|
|`Unrestricted`|This is the default execution policy for non-Windows computers, and it cannot be changed. This policy allows for unsigned scripts to be run but warns the user before running scripts that are not from the local intranet zone.|

#### Windows Security

## User Account Control (UAC)

[User Account Control (UAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) is a security feature in Windows to prevent malware from running or manipulating processes that could damage the computer or its contents. There is the Admin Approval Mode in UAC, which is designed to prevent unwanted software from being installed without the administrator's knowledge or to prevent system-wide changes from being made. Surely you have already seen the consent prompt if you have installed a specific software, and your system has asked for confirmation if you want to have it installed. Since the installation requires administrator rights, a window pops up, asking you if you want to confirm the installation. With a standard user who has no rights for the installation, execution will be denied, or you will be asked for the administrator password. This consent prompt interrupts the execution of scripts or binaries that malware or attackers try to execute until the user enters the password or confirms execution. To understand how UAC works, we need to know how it is structured and how it works, and what triggers the consent prompt. ![[uacarchitecture1.png]]
